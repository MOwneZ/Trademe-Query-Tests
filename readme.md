## Setup
The project environment uses Maven as it's manager. It is required for opening the test and is an easy extention to download using eclipse.
A Chrome driver is required for the UI tests - it can be placed directly in the C:/ drive, and downloaded from here:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Simply creating a new Java project or import the repository to start running the tests. The packages are configured in pom.xml.
